						<h2>HISTORY OF PHP (Example article)</h2>
						<p>PHP originally stood for personal home page.[3] Its development began in 1994 when the Danish/Greenlandic programmer Rasmus Lerdorf initially created a set of Perl scripts he called 'Personal Home Page Tools' to maintain his personal homepage, including tasks such as displaying his résumé and recording how much traffic his page was receiving.[3][4][5]<br/><br/>
						He rewrote these scripts as C programming language Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries, extending them to add the ability to work with web forms and to communicate with databases and called this implementation 'Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter' or PHP/FI. PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. Lerdorf released PHP/FI a<br/><br/>
						s 'Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0' publicly on June 8, 1995, to accelerate bug location and improve the code.[6] This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. The syntax was similar to Perl but was more limited and simpler, although less consistent.[3] A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.<br/><br/>
						Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at the Technion IIT, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[3] Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of<br/><br/>
						PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999.[7] They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel.[3]
